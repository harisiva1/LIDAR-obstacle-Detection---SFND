Compiling and testing:
        Yes it compiles without error.

Bounding box enclose appropriate objects:
        Yes it encloses all the vehicles.

Objects detected across all frames:
        yes and it doesnt gain or lose bounding box in the midle of stream.

3D RANSAC:
        yes i have implemented 3d ransac algorithm for segmentation.
        i have used udacity 2d ransac solution code as reference and build my algorithm for 3d.

clustering:
        yes i have impelmented my own kdtree and euclidean clustering algorithm.
        you can find the kdtree code in "kdtree.h" in src folder.
        i have used udacity solution code as refrence and build my algorithm upon this for building 3d tree.
